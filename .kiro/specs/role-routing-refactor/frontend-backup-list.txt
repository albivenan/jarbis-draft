# Frontend Role Folders - Current State
# No folders with "manajer-" or "staf-" prefixes found

Current role folders:
- crew
- direktur
- hrd
- Keuangan (uppercase K - needs to be lowercase per requirements)
- marketing
- ppic
- produksi
- qc-kayu (should be merged into qc per requirements)
- software-engineer
- supervisor

Note: The structure appears to have been partially migrated already, or the initial state
is different than expected in the design document. The main remaining issues are:
1. Keuangan folder uses uppercase K (should be lowercase)
2. qc-kayu exists but qc-besi is missing (should merge into single qc folder)
3. No separate produksi-besi or produksi-kayu folders found
